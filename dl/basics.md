**Q:** How does a neural network work?

**A:** A neural network model consists of trainable parameters called weights and biases. In the forward pass, the user feeds input data into the model. The model predicts output using the set of weights and biases and computes loss to evaluate the deviation of predicted output from the target using a cost metric commonly known as the loss. In the backpropagation phase, gradients w.r.t the loss is computed and the weights are biases are tuned to minimize the loss.
