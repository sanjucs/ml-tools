**Q:** How does a neural network work?

**A:** A neural network model consists of trainable parameters called weights and biases. In the forward pass, the user feeds input data into the model. The model predicts output using the present set of weights and biases and computes loss to evaluate the deviation of predicted output from the target. In the backpropagation phase, gradients wrt loss is computed and weight are modified in the optimizer step to minimize the loss.
